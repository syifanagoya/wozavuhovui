id=what-reid-hoffman8217s-net-worth><strong>What is Reid Hoffman's Net Worth?</strong></h2><p>Reid Hoffman is an American internet entrepreneur and venture capitalist who has a net worth of $3 billion. Reid Hoffman is best known as the co-founder of the online social network LinkedIn. He also co-founded the AI software company Inflection AI, and is a partner at the venture capital firm Greylock Partners, through which he is a prolific angel investor. Before his success with LinkedIn, Reid was a high-level executive at PayPal, ultimately rising to an Executive Vice President. At PayPal, Hoffman's responsibilities included all external relationships (including payments infrastructure), business development, international, government and legal. He was instrumental to the company's acquisition by eBay and responsible for partnerships with Intuit, Visa, MasterCard and Wells Fargo. Prior to joining PayPal in 1998, Hoffman was the founder of (failed) online dating site SocialNet, which some regard as the first online social network.</p><p>Reid Hoffman famously was one of the earliest investors in Facebook.

The Microsoft deal bought LinkedIn out at $192 per share so Reid's stake was worth $2.8 billion, pre-tax.</p><h2 id=early-life-education><strong>Early Life and Education</strong></h2><p>Reid Hoffman was born on August 5, 1967 in Palo Alto, California to William Jr. and Deanna, and was raised in Berkeley. Growing up, he was passionate about tabletop roleplaying games; at the age of 12, he had his first paid job as an editor at the Oakland-based game company Chaosium. As a teen, Hoffman went to the Putney School in Vermont, where he studied epistemology and farmed maple syrup. He went on to attend Stanford University, earning his BS in cognitive science and symbolic systems. Hoffman subsequently went to the University of Oxford's Wolfson College, from which he graduated with a MSt in philosophy in 1993.</p><h2 id=career-beginnings><strong>Career Beginnings</strong></h2><p>Deciding to pursue an entrepreneurial career after college, Hoffman landed an internship at the Napa Valley winery Inglenook. Following that, he joined Apple Computer, and then Fujitsu. In 1997, Hoffman co-founded his first company, SocialNet.com. He subsequently became a member of the board of directors of PayPal as the company was being founded. In 2000, Hoffman left SocialNet.com to become the COO of PayPal. He was made responsible for the company's external relationships pertaining to business development, government, and payments infrastructure, among other areas. Hoffman was later promoted to executive vice president of PayPal.</p><h2 id=linkedin><strong>LinkedIn</strong></h2><p>In late 2002, Hoffman co-founded LinkedIn with a former college classmate, a former Fujitsu colleague, and two of his former SocialNet.com colleagues. The platform officially launched in May of 2003 as one of the first business-focused online social networks. LinkedIn grew substantially over the years; by late 2014, it had more than 332 million members from around the world, and eventually, it amassed 800 million members.</p><p>For the first four years of LinkedIn's operation, Hoffman was the company's founding CEO. He then became chairman and president of products, before becoming executive chairman in 2009. Two years after that, LinkedIn went public, with Hoffman owning a stake valued at $2.34 billion.</p><h2 id=investing><strong>Investing</strong></h2><p>Beyond his entrepreneurship, Hoffman is known as one of the most prolific and successful angel investors in Silicon Valley. In 2010, he became a partner of the venture capital firm Greylock Partners, and made his first investment in the online lodging marketplace Airbnb.
